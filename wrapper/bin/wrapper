# FIXME: rewrite this in C, or at least as a POSIX shell script.

# Using gcc's -wrapper option, the compiler driver will invoke
# us instead of cc1, etc., with the full command path as $1.
#
# This is a near-noop wrapper whose sole purpose is to run an
# alternative cpp instead of the integrated cc1 one.
# This whole thing is necessary only because -no-integrated-cpp
# no longer works: even if we pass -no-integrated-cpp, it will
# not run `cpp' ever... it uses cc1 -E.
#
# If we are symlinked under a name ending '-cflags', '-cppflags',
# '-ldflags' etc, we print out the options that one should pass
# to the compiler for the wrapper to be employed. So you can do
#
# gcc `/path/to/this/file/wrapper-cflags` <... normal gcc args...>
#
# to run with the alternative cpp.
